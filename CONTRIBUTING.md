### Design principles

- **MCP Server:** Business logic, validation, default values
- **WebSocket Server:** Message routing and protocol translation
- **Figma Plugin:** Pure command executor within the Figma context

### Benefits of this architecture

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable for adding new tools

## Project structure

```
src/
  talk_to_figma_mcp/        # MCP server implementation
    server.ts               # Main entry point
    tools/                  # Tool categories
      document-tools.ts     # Document interaction
      creation-tools.ts     # Shape and element creation
      modification-tools.ts # Property modification
      text-tools.ts         # Text manipulation
    utils/                  # Shared utilities
    types/                  # TypeScript definitions
  claude_mcp_plugin/        # Figma plugin
    code.ts                 # Plugin implementation (TypeScript, strict mode)
    manifest.json           # Plugin configuration
    __tests__/              # Vitest tests with figma mock
```

## Environment setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp.git
cd claude-talk-to-figma-mcp
bun install
```

Build:
- **macOS/Linux:** `bun run build`
- **Windows:** `bun run build:win`

### Create DXT package

To generate your own DXT package for distribution:

```bash
npm run build:dxt
```

This creates `claude-talk-to-figma-mcp.dxt` in the root directory.

## Local development with Claude Desktop

If you're developing new features or fixing bugs, you'll want to test your local changes directly in Claude Desktop.

**Important:** Do not use `bun run configure-claude` for local development, as this script is designed for end users and configures Claude to download the official version from NPM.

### Manual configuration

To use your local version, you must manually edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add (or modify) the entry in `mcpServers` pointing to your locally built file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ClaudeTalkToFigma-Local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/YOUR/PATH/TO/PROJECT/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/dist/talk_to_figma_mcp/server.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Remember that you must run `bun run build` every time you make changes to the server code and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.


## Testing

### Automated tests

```bash
bun run test            # Run all tests
bun run test:watch      # Watch mode
bun run test:coverage   # Coverage report
```

### Integration tests

```bash
bun run test:integration
```

This script guides you step by step to test the complete flow between Claude, the WebSocket server, and Figma.

### Manual verification

Checklist:

- [ ] The WebSocket server starts on port 3055
- [ ] The Figma plugin connects and generates a channel ID
- [ ] The MCP client recognizes "ClaudeTalkToFigma"
- [ ] Basic commands work (create rectangle, change color)
- [ ] Error handling works (invalid commands, timeouts)
- [ ] Channel communication works between client and Figma

For more detailed testing documentation, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

### Ported Community Contributions (Manual Integration)
- **PR #90 (mmabas77)**: Node Info Depth Control.
  - Added `depth` parameter to `get_node_info` and `get_nodes_info` to prevent token overflow.
  - Smart truncation: deeper nodes are returned as stubs (`{id, name, type}`) instead of being fully expanded.
  - Significant reduction (~98%) of payload size for large Figma documents.
- **PR #87 (mmabas77)**: Plugin Quality Improvements.
  - Robust layout grids (handling STRETCH vs fixed-pixel modes).
  - Enhanced `clone_node` with `parentId` support.
  - Smart text wrapping and numeric font weight mapping.
  - Unified styling (fill/stroke) for all basic shape creation tools.
  - Automatic column grids for top-level frames.
  - Safe color utilities to prevent accidental black-fills on corrupt data.
- **PR #85 (hoxinzhen)**: Component Detaching.
- **PR #83 (Kejsaren)**: Local Style Creation.
